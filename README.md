# AGM-Excel
This site has Excel templates that are referenced in the Assay Guidance Manual (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53196/)
More specifically, they are to be used for analyzing data related to the statistical
validation of biological assays. The templates fall into three categories:

1. Plate Uniformity
2. Replicate Experiment
3. Control Charting

For plate uniformity and replicate experiment templates, see the HTS Validation chapter (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83783/)
For control charting, see the Assay Operations chapter (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK91994/)
